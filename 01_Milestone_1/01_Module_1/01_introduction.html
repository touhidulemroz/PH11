Introduction about HTML
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a standard markup language used to create web pages.
HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.
HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see on the Internet is written using one version of HTML code or another.
